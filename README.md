# Fatigue Life Analysis using Basquin's Equation

This repository contains Python code to analyze fatigue life data using Basquin's equation. The code compares experimental data with predictions from a Hybrid Physics-Informed Neural Network (HPINN) and a synthetic dataset generated using Basquin's equation as a control. The goal is to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the HPINN model against experimental and synthetic data.

## Introduction

Fatigue life analysis is critical for understanding material behavior under cyclic loading. Basquin's equation is widely used to model the relationship between stress amplitude and fatigue life. This project:
- Fits Basquin's equation to experimental data.
- Compares experimental results with predictions from a Hybrid Physics-Informed Neural Network (HPINN).
- Uses a synthetic dataset generated using Basquin's equation as a control for validation.

The code produces:
- A plot comparing experimental, HPINN, and synthetic Basquin predictions.
- Tabulated results including RÂ² and RMSE values for each dataset.
